  <h1>üß† ABOUT ME</h1>

  <div id="intro-terminal"></div>

  <div class="intro">
    <p>I was born in Chiraq, bounced to Jersey, lived in Central America, and came back ‚Äî but not like you think. My family couldn‚Äôt fly, so we walked across the border. Real story. Real grit.</p>
    <p>In Jersey, I got into school and caught a spark for computers. I was 11 when someone gifted me a PC ‚Äî I tore it apart and learned everything inside. Figured out Ethernet, then WiFi, then chatrooms‚Ä¶ then hacked 'em. But while I was leveling up in the digital world, I was also training hands in the physical one. Karate first. That was mid. So I stepped into a gritty boxing gym and never looked back. Started taking down bullies and stacking self-respect. Won some soccer trophies too ‚Äî but boxing was the only sport I could sit and *feel*.</p>
    <p>I was a nerd, but I hid it. My friends saw me as an alpha, so I played the part. That led to trouble. But I kept my mind moving. Ended up in construction ‚Äî made it to Project Manager. Dreamed of being an unlicensed architect. Wanted to build plazas. I was checking goals off. Then life hit back ‚Äî laid off, deceived, the whole nine. But I ain‚Äôt crying over it.</p>
    <p>Back in juvie, I gave myself the name <strong>El Caso Depaz</strong> ‚Äî an acronym: <em>‚ÄúCentral America Sangre Original Derrotando Enemigos Preparando Amazonas.‚Äù</em></p>
    <p>Now? I go by <strong>FireFightsTV</strong>. I post boxing content. I study hacking. I build tools. I teach what I learn. From <strong>hard hats to hard drives</strong> ‚Äî I wear both. This site is my fusion of combat and code. My roots are underground, but now I'm rising through the system, teaching others how to think like hackers and fight like champions.</p>
